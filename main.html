      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>It is an interesting field that is combining clever compositions, editorial layout, and creative typography. All those elements brought together create an outstanding newspaper layout.

People worldwide are staying up late by night, creating compositions that a lot of people get a hold of as magazine layout designs, newspaper designs, book covers, and other editorials add-ons.

The editorial designer plays a very important role in the way in which information is shared, presented, and understood. Especially given the last function, this discipline can really bring some transcendental change to society.

Designing magazines, books, and newspapers is becoming really challenging as the digital is taking over most of the communications and changing accordingly the magazine designs..</p>

    <h2> My work </h2>

<p> It was my first time having to create the magazine cover. With little time given it was a challange to explore the software fully,and find a suiting topic. After a while, I decided to go with life-style magazine concept. At the time I was inspired by one of the books I had just read- from there the name Ikigai. All of the pictures used were taken from open source website called unsplashed. Deciding for such a simpel thing as a font was also a challange. Yet after long thoughts I have decided to go with Perpetua. I find this typography realy good for magazines of this style. I also had some other fonts on my mind (such as Didot, Bodoni,Helvetica, Gill Sans), yet this one was my number one. 
    The final effect is not ideal, but it was a really nice experimentation.
